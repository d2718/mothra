A minimal wireless and wired network client.

[wicd](https://launchpad.net/wicd) quit on me when I updated to Ubuntu 16 on my netbook. Poking around for a solution made it seem like I might just be able to write a replacement.

On further poking, it appears that the use of a wireless client daemon nets you hardly anything if you're willing to edit a couple of text files, so it's entirely possible this project may never even get started. Don't stay tuned.
